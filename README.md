## Python calculator

Python programming is a great tool to evaluate and make manipulations.Weâ€™ll be using mathematical operators, conditional statements, functions and handle user input to make our calculator.In this project, we ask the user to choose an operation. Options 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are valid. If any other input is given, Invalid Input is displayed. User-defined functions addition(), subtraction(), multiplication() and average() evaluate respective operations and display the output.
